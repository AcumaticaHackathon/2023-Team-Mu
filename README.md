# Acumatica - Hackathon '23 - Team-Mu

AutoMatica - Build Smarter, Not Harder

AutoMatica is an all in one Cusotmization Package manager. 
No longer do Admin's have to wait until 2 am to publish a customization project.
No longer do Developer's need to tirelessly scrape through technical release notes for each minor and major upgrade.

Admin's can schedule the publish of customization packages. At the scheduled time if a publish encounters any difficulty, the assigned admin will receive email notication with all the trace log error report. 
At upgrade time, Admin's can quickly find any DAC's or BUsiness Logic changes that pertain to their customization project.
